# Threat Intelligence Report

## Types of Attacks
- **SQL Injection** – Exploiting vulnerable input fields to execute malicious queries.  
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** – Injecting malicious scripts into web applications to target users.  
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE)** – Executing arbitrary code on the target server due to unpatched software.  
- **Privilege Escalation** – Gaining higher-level access through misconfigurations or vulnerabilities.  
- **Brute Force / Credential Stuffing** – Using automated tools to guess passwords or reuse leaked credentials.

## How Exploited Vulnerabilities Provide Access
An **unpatched web application vulnerability** can allow attackers to:  
- Inject malicious code or commands into the system.  
- Bypass authentication and access restricted areas.  
- Establish persistence by installing backdoors or malware.  
- Move laterally within the network to compromise other systems.

## Preventive Measures
1. **Patch Management** – Regularly apply security patches and updates to OS, applications, and dependencies.  
2. **Web Application Firewall (WAF)** – Filter and monitor HTTP traffic to block malicious payloads.  
3. **Secure Coding Practices** – Validate and sanitize inputs, enforce least privilege access, and use parameterized queries.  
4. **Vulnerability Scanning** – Run automated scans and penetration tests to detect weaknesses early.  
5. **Security Awareness Training** – Educate developers and employees about secure practices and phishing risks.
